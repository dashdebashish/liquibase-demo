- Show the Folder structure for best practices
- Show how the Master YAML is calling all the SQL files
- Explain about 
    "--liquibase formatted sql" 
    "--changeset Debashish:1"
	--rollback

  (d) runAlways:True to be added along with the Change Set Id (--changeset Debashish:1594898257424-1 runAlways:True), 
      to execute the sql everytime when there is a change
